This is the <i>Vim</i> cookbook page.  It contains short recipes for doing
many simple and not so simple things in <i>Vim</i>.  You should already
know the basics of <i>Vim</i>, however each command is explained in detail.

<p>
If you type fast your fingers can easily get ahead of your mind. Frequently
people transpose characters.  For example the  word "the" comes out "teh". </p><p>
To swap two characters, for example "e" with "h", put the cursor on the cursor
on the "e" and type <tt><u>xp</u></tt>.  
</p><p>
The "x" command deletes a character (the "e") and the "p" pastes it after the
cursor (which is now placed over the "h".)
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="interactive replace">
Interactively replacing one word with another (n. method)</a></h2>
Suppose you want to replace every occurrence of the word "idiot" with the word
"manager". But you want the chance to review each change before you do it.<p>
Here's what you do:
</p><p>
</p><table>
<tbody><tr>
    <td>1.</td>
    <td><tt><u>1G</u></tt></td>
    <td>Go to the top of the document</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>2.</td>
    <td><tt><u>/idiot&lt;enter&gt;</u></tt></td>
    <td>Find the first occurrence of the word "idiot"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>3.</td>
    <td><tt><u>cwmanager</u></tt></td>
    <td>Change the word (<tt><u>cw</u></tt>) to manager.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>4.</td>
    <td><tt><u>n</u></tt></td>
    <td>Repeat the last search (find the next idiot.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>5. </td>
    <td><tt><u>.</u></tt></td>
    <td>Repeat the last edit (change one word to manager)
    <br>
	(If you do not want to change the word, skip this step.)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you have replaced all occurred.

</p><blockquote>
<h3>The Virgin What!?</h3>
<p>
A church had just bought their first computer and were learning how to
use it. The church secretary decided to set up a form letter to be used in a
funeral service. Where the person's name was to be she put in the word
"&lt;name&gt;". When a funeral occurred she would change this word to the
actual name of the departed.
</p>
<p>
One day, there were two funerals, first for a lady named Mary, then later one
for someone named Edna. So the secretary used global replace to change
"&lt;name&gt;" to "Mary." So far so good. Next she generated the service for
the second funeral by changing the word "Mary" to "Edna." That was a mistake 
</p>
<p>
Imagine the Minister's surprise when he started reading the part containing the
Apostle's Creed and saw, "Born of the Virgin Edna."

In actual practice what you in most <i>Makefile</i>s (file that

Notice that the backslash (\) is used to indicate a continuation line. 
After sorting this looks like:

</p><h2><a name="sob">Dealing with Makefile and other SOB files </a></h2>
<p>
One problem with the file format used by the UNIX <i>make</i> command is that
it's extremely fussy.
</p>
<p>
For example, the following is correct:
</p>
<pre>        prog: prog.c
                cc -g -o prog prog.c
</pre>
<p>
The following is not:
</p><pre>        prog: prog.c
                cc -g -o prog prog.c
</pre>
<p>
At first glance you might think that these two are exactly.  But look closer.
The "cc" line of the first one begins with a tab.  The second one begins with
eight spaces. (You can't tell the difference between a space and a tab when
it's printed on the screen!  You need a better video card.)
</p><p>
So how are you supposed to tell them apart especially when one the screen (or
the printed page) they look exactly the same.
</p><p>
The answer is you can't.  You might think that's a bit unfair.  Especially when
<i>make</i> works on the first one but not the second.  But who every said UNIX
was fair.
</p><p>
Fortunately <i>Vim</i> has a mode that tells you exactly what's in your file.
Executing the command
</p><p>
</p><pre>	<u>:set list</u>
</pre>
puts you into this mode.  When the display is set into "list mode" all
characters print.  Tabs show up as "^I" and the end of line shows up as $.  So
in list mode, our two examples look like:
<pre>        prog: prog.c$
        ^Icc -g -o prog prog.c$
</pre>
<p>
and
</p><pre>        prog: prog.c$
                cc -g -o prog prog.c$
</pre>
<p>
From this it's easy to see which line has the tab.
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="format_para">Formatting a text paragraph</a></h2>
<p>
The <i>Vim</i> editor is  not a word processor.  
Boy is it not a word processor.
There are a couple of things you can do to make things better for you when
editing text.
</p><p>
Word processors automatically wrap when you type a line 
that's longer than the margins.  The <i>Vim</i> editor lets make a 
line as long as you want.  By executing the command:
</p><pre>        <u>:set wrapmargin=70</u>
</pre>
<p>
you can tell <i>Vim</i> to automatically break lines 
when the run longer than 70 characters.  
(You can adjust this number to whatever line length you want.)
</p><p>
This makes entering text much easier.  
It doesn't solve the problem of editing.
If you enter a paragraph and then decide to 
delete half the words on the first
line, <i>Vim</i> will not reformat the text.
</p><p>
You can force a reformat of a paragraph by executing  the commands:

<h2><a name="find_c">Finding a procedure in a C program </a></h2>
<p>
The <i>Vim</i> program was designed by programmers for programmers. 
You can use it to locate procedures within a set of C or C++ program files.
</p><p>
But first you must generate a table of contest file called a "tags" file.
(This file has been given the obvious name <i>tags</i>.)  The <i>ctags</i>
command generates this table of contents files.
</p><p>
To generate a table of contents of all the C program files in your current
working directory, use the command:
</p><pre>        $<b> ctags *.c</b>
</pre>
<p>
For C++ use the command:
</p><pre>        $ <b>ctags *.cpp</b>
</pre>
<p>
If you use an extension other than .cpp for your C++ 
files, use it instead of <tt>.cpp</tt>.
</p><p>
Once this file is generated, you tell <i>Vim</i> 
that you want edit a procedure, and it will find the file 
containing that procedure and position you there.
For example if you want to edit the procedure 
write_file use the command:
</p><pre>        $ <b>vim</b><i> -t write_file</i>
</pre>
<p>
Now suppose as you are looking at the write_file procedure that it calls
setup_data and you need to look at that procedure. To jump to that function,
position the cursor at the beginning of the word setup_data and press Ctrl+].
This tells <i>Vim</i> to jump to the definition of this procedure.  This
repositioning will occur even if <i>Vim</i> has to change files to do so.
</p><p>
</p><h3 align="center">Note:</h3>
If you've edited the current file and not saved it, <i>Vim</i>
will issue a warning and ignore the Ctrl+] command.
<hr>
<h2><a name="drawing">Drawing comment boxes</a></h2>
<p>
I like to put a big comment box at the top of each of my procedures.  For
example:
</p><pre>	/*******************************************************
	 * Program -- Solve it -- Solves the worlds problems.  *
	 *     All of them.  At once.  This will be a great    *
	 *   program when I finish it.                         *
	 *******************************************************/
</pre>
<p>
Drawing these boxes like this is tedious at best.  
But <i>Vim</i> has a nice feature called abbreviations that 
makes things easier.
</p><p>
First, you need to create a <i>Vim</i> initialization file called
<i>~/.vimrc</i>.  (At first this may look like a <i>ex</i> initialization file.
It is. The <i>Vim</i> command is actually a mode of the <i>ex</i> editor.)
</p><p>
The <i>~/.vimrc</i> file need to contain the lines:
</p><pre>        :ab #b /************************************************
        :ab #e ************************************************/
</pre>
<p>
These command define a set of <i>Vim</i> abbreviations.
What's a <i>Vim</i> abbreviation?  
Its a word that stands for another word.  When <i>Vim</i> see the
abbreviation, it will expand it to the full word.  In this case we've defined
an abbreviation called <tt><u>#b</u></tt> 
that expands to the beginning line of a comment
box.  The  <tt><u>#e</u></tt> abbreviation does the same thing. 
</p><p>
So to create a comment box enter #b&lt;enter&gt;.  The screen looks like:
</p><pre>        /************************************************
</pre>
Enter the comments, including the beginning and ending "*" characters. 
Finally end the comment by typing <tt><u>#e&lt;enter&gt;</u></tt>.  
This causes the ending comment to be entered.
<p>
</p><h3 align="center">Note:</h3>
<p>
This page was written in <i>Vim</i>.  So how did we
enter the #b and #e?  Easy, we typed in #bb and the deleted a character. 
(We couldn't enter #b or it would have been 
expanded.) 
</p><p>
Some other useful commands that programmer may want to put in
their <i>~/.exrc</i> include:
</p><pre>	:set autoindent
	:set autowrite
	:ab #d #define
	:ab #i #include
	:ab #b /************************************************
	:ab #e ************************************************/
	:ab #l /*----------------------------------------------*/
	:set sw=4
</pre>
<p>
The autoindent setting causes <i>Vim</i> to 
indent new lines by a similar amount
to the one next to them.  
This is very useful for entering programs.  The
autowrite setting tells <i>Vim</i> to write the old file out when switching from
one file to another.
</p><p>
The abbreviations <tt><u>#d</u></tt>, 
<tt><u>#i</u></tt>, and <tt><u>#l</u></tt>, 
define useful terms for programmers.
</p><p>
Finally, the command set <tt><u>sw=4</u></tt> sets the shift width 
(the number of characters
text is moved sideways for the shift command 
(<tt><u>&lt;&lt;</u></tt> and <tt><u>&gt;&gt;</u></tt>)).
</p><p>
This is very useful if you use a 4 space indentation for your C or C++
programs.  (Studies at Rice University have shown this to be the best
indentation size.)
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="reading">Reading a man page</a></h2>
<p>
You can use the <i>Vim</i> editor to browse through text files.  One of the most
useful set of files to browse through is the man pages.   To do this
we assemble a pipeline of three command.
</p><p>
The first is <i>man</i> which gets the page.  The next one, <i>ul</i>
turns the underline and bold escape codes into something readable, and 
finally we use <i>Vim</i> to broswe the file.
</p><p>
So our command is:
</p><blockquote>
<pre>$ man <i>subject</i> | ul -i | vim -
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The man page will be generated and then displayed in the <i>Vim</i>
window.  You can now use your normal editing commands to browse the
files.
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="eol">Removing carriage returns from MS-DOS file</a></h2>
<p>
If you ever try to edit a MS-DOS file, you'll notice that each line
ends with a <tt><u>^M</u></tt> character.  This is caused by the funny
way that MS-DOS treats the end-of-line.  
(For some background on this problem take a look at 
 <a href="http://www.oualline.com/practical.programmer/eol.html">The EOL Story</a>.
</p><p>
To remove the ^M characters from a MS-DOS file, enter the command:
</p><pre>	<b>:1,$s/{Ctrl+V}{Ctrl+M}//{Enter}</b>
</pre>
This command starts with a colon (<tt><u>:</u></tt>) to
tell <i>Vim</i> to enter <i>ex</i> mode.  All <i>ex</i>
start with a line number range, in this case its from
the first line (1) to the last ($). The slash indicates
the start of the "from text".  The <tt><u>{Ctrl+V}</u></tt> tells <i>Vim</i>
to treat the next character as a regular character even
if it's a special one.	The next character is <tt><u>{Ctrl+M}</u></tt>.
(This would be treated as <tt><u>{Enter}</u></tt> without the 
<tt><u>{Ctrl+V}</u></tt>.)
The next slash ends the "from text". What follows is the
"to text" enclosed by slashes.	In this case it's nothing
(<tt><u>//</u></tt>).  
<hr>
<h2><a name="trim">Trimming the blanks off an end of line </a></h2>
Some people find spaces and
tabs at the end of a line useless, wasteful, and ugly.
To remove whitespace at the end of every line, execute
the command:<p> 
</p><pre>	<b>:1,$s/[ &lt;tab&gt;]*$//</b>
</pre>
<p>
The colon
(:) tells <i>Vim</i> to enter <i>ex</i> command mode. All
<i>ex</i> commands start with a line range, in this case,
the entire file (line 1 to the last line: $).  
</p><p> 
The
first set of slashes enclose the "from text".  The square
brackets indicate that either character can be a match.
So <tt><u>[ &lt;tab&gt;]</u></tt> matches either space or tab.  The star
(<tt><u>*</u></tt>) means that the previous character specification
(space or tab) can be repeated any of number times.
The dollar (<tt><u>$</u></tt> indicates an end of line.	
</p><p> 
So <tt><u>[ &lt;tab&gt;]*$</u></tt>
tells <i>Vim</i> to look for any number of spaces or tabs
followed by an end of line.  
</p><p> 
These are then replaced by
the text in the next set of slashes. This text is nothing,
so the spaces and tabs are effectively removed.  
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="write">Oops, I left the file write protected</a></h2> 
<p>
Say your editing a file and you've made a lot
of changes. This is a very important file and to preserve
it from any casual changes, you've write protected it,
even  against yourself.
</p><p> 
The <i>Vim</i> editor allows you
to edit a write protected file with little or no warning.
The only trouble is that when you try to exit using "<tt><u>ZZ</u></tt>"
you get the error:
</p><pre>    file.txt	File is read only
</pre>
<p> 
and
<i>Vim</i> doesn't exit. 
</p><p> 
So what can you do?  You don't
want to throw away all those changes, but you need to get
out of <i>Vim</i> so you can turn on write permission.
</p><p>
The trick is to execute the <tt><u>:shell</u></tt> command. This command
takes you out of <i>Vim</i> by starting a command processor
(shell) running under <i>Vim</i></p><p> You can then write
enable the file:
</p><pre> 
	$ <b>chmod u+w file.txt</b>
</pre>
and get out of the shell, returning to <i>Vim</i>
<pre>	$ <b>exit</b>
</pre> 
<p>
Finally you need to force <i>Vim</i> to write
the file using the command:
</p><pre>	<b>:w!</b>
</pre>
(It still thinks the file is write protected so we need to use
the force option (<tt><u>!</u></tt>) to convince it to try writing.)
<p>
</p><h3 align="center">Note:</h3>
<p>
It is
a good idea to only spend as short a time as possible in
a command processor started by the :shell command. That's
because it's easy to forget that you're running under
<i>Vim</i>.  It's possible to start a shell, that starts
<i>Vim</i>, that starts a shell, that starts <i>Vim</i>,
that ....  Using this method you can easily consume a lot
of resources and generate a lot of confusion.
</p><p> 
By keeping
your <tt><u>:shell</u></tt> sessions short you can avoid lots of trouble.
</p><hr>
<h2><a name="last">Changing "Last, First" to "First Last"</a></h2>
<p>
You have a list of names in the form:
</p><pre>	Last, First
</pre>
<p>
How to you change them to:
</p><pre>	First Last
</pre>
It can be done with one command:
<pre>    <b>:1,$s/\([^,]*\), \(.*$\)/\2 \1/</b>
</pre>
The colon (<tt><u>:</u></tt>) tells <i>Vim</i>
that this is an <i>ex</i> style command.
<p> 
The line range for this command is the whole file as indicated by
the range <tt><u>1,$</u></tt>.	
</p><p> 
The <tt><u>s</u></tt> (substitute) tells <i>Vim</i>
to do a string substitution.
</p><p> 
The old text is a complex
regular expression.  The  <tt><u>\( ... \)</u></tt> delimiters are used
to inform the editor that the text that matches the
regular expression side is to be treated special.
</p><p>
The text in the first <tt><u>\( ... \)</u></tt> is assigned to 
<tt><u>\1</u></tt> in the replacement text.  
The second set of text inside <tt><u>\( ... \)</u></tt> is assigned 
<tt><u>\2</u></tt> and so on.
</p><p> 
In this case the
first regular expression is any bunch of characters that
does not include a comma. The <tt><u>[^,]</u></tt> means anything but a
comma, the * means a bunch (zero or more characters).
</p><p>
The second expression matches anything: <tt><u>.*</u></tt> up to the end
of line: <tt><u>$</u></tt>.
</p><p> 
The result of this substitution is that
the first word on the line is assigned to <tt><u>\1</u></tt> and the
second to <tt><u>\2</u></tt>.  These values are used in the end of the
command to reverse the word.
</p><p>
The figure below shows the
relationship between the <tt><u>\( \)</u></tt> 
enclosed strings and the <tt><u>\1</u></tt>,
<tt><u>\2</u></tt> markers.
</p><pre>	:1,$s/\([^,]*\), \(.*$\)/\2 \1/
	      ^^     ^^  ^^   ^^^ ^  ^            
	      ||     ||  ||   ||| |  +-----  String matched by

	      ++-----++--------------------- First \( \)

<h2><a name="all_files">How to edit all the files containing a given word</a></h2>
<p>
This involves the <i>fgrep</i>
as well as the special shell character backtick (<tt><u>`</u></tt>).
</p><p>
To edit all the C program files that contain the word
<i>indentation_level</i> execute the command:
</p><pre>    $ <b><i>vim</i> `fgrep -l indentation_level *.c`</b>
</pre>
<p> The <tt><u>fgrep -l indentation_level *.c</u></tt> 
searches all the files ending with
<i>.c</i> for the word and lists them out.
</p><p> 
Since this command
is enclosed in backtick (<tt><u>`</u></tt>) characters the results of
the command (a list of files) takes the place of the
command on the command line.</p><p> The <i>Vim</i> editor
is then run on these files.  The commands <tt><u>:n{Enter}</u></tt> and
<tt><u>:rew{Enter}</u></tt> can then be used to browse through the files.
</p><h2><a name="all_files_grep">How to edit all the files containing a given word using the built-in grep</a></h2>
<p>
Start <i>Vim</i>.
</p><p>
Execute the command:
</p><pre>    :grep <i>&gt;word&lt;</i> <i>&gt;file-list&lt;</i>

<p>
This finds the first location of <i>word</i> in the given files and
positions the cursor on that line.   You can use the command
<tt>:cn</tt>  to find the next occurance.
