Whenever I learn a new skill, I concoct elaborate fantasy scenarios where it lets save the day.
Oh no! The killer must have followed her on vacation!
But to find we'd have to search through 200MB of email looking for something formatted like an address!
It's hopeless!
Everybody stand back.
I know regular expressions.
PERL!
翻译：
每当我学习一项新技能，我就可以制作奇幻的场景并拯救世界。
不，凶手一定会在休假地跟踪她！
但是为此我们不得不从200兆的Email中寻找看起来想地址一样的东西！
这个太难了！
所有人退后，我知道正则表达式。

that the professors loved to put papers on top of
the equipment, covering the ventilation holes. Many
terminals broke down because they became so hot that
the solder holding one of the chips melted and the
chip fell out.
The student technicians were used to this problem. One
day a technician took the back off a terminal

Calls and letters to the company failed to correct
this problem. Finally the fellow just gave up and
wrote a check for $0.00 and the bills ceased.

A Californian who loved sailing went down and applied
for a personalized license plate. He filled in his
three choices as 1)SAIL 2)SAILING and 3)NONE. He got
a new plate labeled "NONE."

Unfortunately, when the police write out a ticket

======================================================

This is a test.
